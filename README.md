# Vehicle Detection and Counting

This project demonstrates vehicle detection and counting using Haar cascade classifiers and OpenCV. It includes code to detect cars and buses in images and videos.

## Description

In this project, we utilize the OpenCV library along with Haar cascade classifiers to detect and count vehicles in images and videos. The code demonstrates the following functionalities:

- Image Processing and Preprocessing
- Object Detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers
- Drawing Rectangles Around Detected Vehicles
- Creating Output Video with Detected Vehicles

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy
- Requests

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless pillow numpy requests

## Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/22m0052-Rajat/Vehicle-detection-and-counting.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd vehicle-detection

Run the Python script to perform vehicle detection on images and videos:
vehicle_detect_count.ipynb

The script will process the provided sample images and videos, detect vehicles, draw rectangles around them, and create an output video with the detection results.
